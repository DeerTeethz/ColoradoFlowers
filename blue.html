Blue Flowers
<there are minimal flowers that are truly blue from colorado. But this one is so vibrant it makes up for the lack of blue floweres here!>

<h2>Alpine Forget-Me-Not</h2>
<img src="blue.jpg" alt="vibrant cluster of multiple flower heads covering the majority of their bush">
<img src="blue2.jpg" alt="closeup of a forget-me-not flower">
<img src="blue3.jpg" alt="lighter blue forget-me-nots on a more visible bush">
<p>They live in the northern rocky mountain and enjoy their hillsides and meadows, especialy of they get a lot of moisture.<br>
The flowers form small clumps at the end of their stems, and most plants grow quite a few of them. Foget-Me-nots like to grow at a angle as well.</p>
