<p>They have spindly vibrant red petals that reach upwards in a cluster. The desert paintbrush tends to have multiple heads in a plant. They have spindly green petals in a similair shap to their flowers, though they can become other colors too.
<br>they are found throughout colorado in our grasslands and almost desert regions</p>

<h2 id="kingcup">Kingcup hedgehog cactus</h2>
<img src="cactus1.jpg" alt="large cactus cluster with some half-bloomed red kingcups">
<p>This cactus is a more varied species so the only trusty way to identify it is through its flowers. They have rounded petals that form a cup-like shape(super cute) and are usually vibrant red or orange. 
<br>Their cacti parts however can have all sorts of spine patterns, though usually they tend to be straight small pines. They grow in big clusters in round small shapes but can also be a little longer and taller in shape as well. Whatever the cactus is feeling it seems. They can be found towards the south and west regions of colorado in dry areas.</p>

<h2 id="beard">Beaked beardtongue</h2>
<img src="beard1.jpg" alt="closeup of a muted red beardtongue flowers">
<p>These vibrant flowers are most native to California but tey live in Colorado too. Found in our shrublands and canyon areas. Flowering season is during the summer. They can reach 3 feet in height, and have lobe-petals that curl all the way back at the tip. Their leaves are vibrant and spindly. Their stems can become a dry brown.
<br> They do not do much other than look gorgeous but that is enough for me! Great for gorgeous gardens if you live in a particularly dry region.</p>
