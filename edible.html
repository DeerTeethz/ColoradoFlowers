<h2 id="prickly">Prickly Rose</h2>
<p>
These are a lighter purple small flower with four ish main rose petals. They have jagged leaves and a yellow center once in bloom. these flowers form rose hips that are used primarily in teas. Unfurtunately for me I hate rosehip tea. But one man's meat is another's poison. These cute flowers can be found near mountain regions alongside streams or any area that gets enough moisture.
