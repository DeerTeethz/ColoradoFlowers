<h2 id="chocolate">Chocolate Flower</h2>

<p>These flowers asre called chocolate flowers for the smell that comes from the flower. 
Unfortunately the internet told me that most chocolate flowers are not super edible. But still great to keep around for the chocolate smell!
They grow locally in rocky/gravely areas. They have large isolated flowers and a large maroon center. They can also grow up to four feet.</p>

<h2 id="parsely">Mountain Parsely</h2>

<img src="parsely.jpg" alt=" a picture of four small mountain parsely flowers">

<p>These are more localized around Colorado and rocky mountain states specifically. Typically found in and around the mountains.
They are typically yellow or white, but have also been found with red flowers. The stem branches out into multiple clusters in which the flowers bloom.
They also belong to the carrot family, which is cool.</p>

<h2 id="hawksbeard">Meadow Hawksbeard</h2>

<p>These are small flowers that appear on long leafless stems. They have many small thin petals with long leaves at the base of the plant. 
They can be found in grasslands and meadows. And they are super cute!</p>
